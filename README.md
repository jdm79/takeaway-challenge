# Takeaway Challenge

Takeaway Challenge (see the Makers Github repo [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/takeaway-challenge "Makers Takeaway Challenge Github") for more info) responds to the following brief:

*Ensure you have a list of dishes with prices. Place the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total. If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".. The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. Itâ€™s free. Make sure that your Takeaway is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run*

Takeaway Challenge is the second weekend challenge on the Makers Course, reinforcing our use and understanding of TDD and OOP, with the added spice of interacting with a real-world API!
